  <h1>History of Budapest</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 15px; color: black;" absolute-drag>Around the year 1000 Stephen (István) I, King of Hungary, organized a feudal state on the Central 
    European model and introduced Christianity. A few years later merchants from central and western Europe settled in Buda and Pest and 
    helped both places to develop rapidly. In 1241-42 Mongols stormed the Danube towns of Buda and Pest.  A few years later the construction 
    of the Castle of Buda ordered by King Béla IV was completed. The royal court moved to Buda in 1347 again, when work was begun to expand 
    the fortification into a palace in contemporary Gothic style. From then on Buda became a royal town, while Pest developed into a 
    prosperous trading center. In the second half of the 15th C Matthias Corvinus extended the Royal Palace and Buda, together with Visegrád, 
    became a center of Renaissance culture.
     <br>
     <br>
    t was 1686 before Charles of Lorraine was able to reconquest Óbuda, Buda and Pest for the House of Habsburg. Various measures taken 
    during the reign of Empress Maria Theresa led to a further economic upsurge in Buda and Pest, largely brought about by an influx of 
    German-speaking settlers. In 1777 Buda was made a university town but lost this title to Pest a few years later. The left bank of the 
    Danube soon became the intellectual and political center of the country. In 1848-49 there was a civil revolution led by liberal nobles.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Chain Bridge was opened in 1849, with the aim of helping Óbuda, Buda and Pest to merge more quickly. In 1867 Emperor Franz Joseph I 
    and Empress Elisabeth ("Sissi") were crowned in Matthias Church. The Austro-Hungarian monarchy of the Danube came into being. In the 
    history of Budapest the year 1872 stands out as a milestone, for it was then that the three separate settlements of Pest, Buda and Óbuda 
    (literally "Old" Buda) were united into one city with a population of more than 150,000. Budapest officially became the capital city of 
    Hungary, and underwent rapid growth in size and eminence. This was the city's golden age, and coincided with the Hungarian millennial 
    celebrations in 1896 when the continental Europe's first underground railroad was opened. At the outbreak of the First World War many
    well-known industrial firms established themselves in the Budapest region.
