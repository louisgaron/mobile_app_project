  <h1>History of Maldives</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 15px; color: black;" absolute-drag>Archaeological finds reveal that the islands 
    were inhabited as early as 1500 BCE. The first settlers arrived around 500 BCE and are thought to 
    have been Aryans. In the pre-Islamic period (before CE 1153), according to the accounts of Persian and 
    Arab travellers, the Maldives was ruled by women. After that date, only four queens ruled, the last one in the early 16th century.
     <br>
     <br>
    Although the Maldives voluntarily accepted a period of British protection, the country has been an independent state throughout its 
    known history, except for a very brief period (15 years) of Portuguese occupation in the 16th century and an even briefer three months 
    and 20 days of Mopla (south Indian) rule in the mid- 18th century. The Maldivian militia (controlled by the Sultan) defended the country 
    and its independence against incursions by stronger powers. Since the country’s conversion to Islam, its history can be traced through a 
    number of dynasties, ruled by 93 Sultans and Sultanas, whose laws were only acknowledged when exercised for the benefit of the people. 
    Otherwise, the ruler, who was advised by councillors, could be dethroned.
    <br>
    <br>
    The recent history of Maldives has been characterised by stability, growth and gradual adjustment to a modern economy. The only interruption 
    to this steady progress was an attempted coup in late 1988, involving an attempted invasion. This was quickly put down with the aid of Indian troops. 
    In the early 1990s, President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom devolved some presidential powers, introduced other reforms and established an anti-corruption board.
