  <h1>History of the Philippines</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 15px; color: black;" absolute-drag>The history of the Philippines 
     from 1521 to 1898, also known as the Spanish colonial period,
     started with the arrival in 1521 of European explorer Ferdinand Magellan sailing for Spain,
     which heralded the period when the Philippines was a colony of the Spanish Empire, and ended
     with the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898, which marked the beginning of the American
     colonial era of Philippine history.
     <br>
     <br>
    Magellan conquered and sought alliances among the natives beginning with Datu Zula,
    the chieftain of Sugbu (now Cebu), and took special pride in converting them to Catholicism. 
    Magellan's expedition got involved in the political rivalries between the Cebuano natives and 
    took part in a battle against Lapu-lapu, chieftain of Mactan island and a mortal enemy of Datu Zula. 
    At dawn on 27 April 1521, Magellan invaded Mactan Island with 60 armed men and 1,000 Cebuano warriors, 
    but had great difficulty landing his men on the rocky shore. Lapu-Lapu had an army of 1,500 on land. Magellan 
    waded ashore with his soldiers and attacked the Mactan defenders, ordering Datu Zula and his warriors to 
    remain aboard the ships and watch. Magellan seriously underestimated Lapu-Lapu and his men, and grossly 
    outnumbered, Magellan and 14 of his soldiers were killed. The rest managed to reboard the ships.
    <br>
    <br>
    The battle left the expedition with too few crewmen to man three ships, so they abandoned the "Concepción". 
    The remaining ships - "Trinidad" and "Victoria" – sailed to the Spice Islands in present-day Indonesia. From there,
    the expedition split into two groups. The Trinidad, 
    commanded by Gonzalo Gómez de Espinoza tried to sail eastward across the Pacific Ocean to the Isthmus of Panama.
    Disease and shipwreck disrupted Espinoza's voyage and most of the crew died. Survivors of the Trinidad returned to 
    the Spice Islands, where the Portuguese imprisoned them. The Victoria continued sailing westward, commanded by Juan 
    Sebastián Elcano, and managed to return to Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Spain in 1522. In 1529, Charles I of Spain relinquished 
    all claims to the Spice Islands to Portugal in the treaty of Zaragoza. However, the treaty did not stop the colonization of 
    the Philippine archipelago from New Spain.
